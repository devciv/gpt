This is the Great Person Tracker (for Science Victories). It's as good as scribbling down the Great People on the back of a napkin and crossing them out. Just don't refresh the page.

Production and Science numbers are based on Standard speed. Playing on Online speed will halve the benefits. For example, Janaki Ammal will help you gain 200 Science for each rainforest tile here or adjacent. Another example is Alfred Nobel will apply 50 free Great People points towards recruiting all current or future people.
